// Linear search means:-Searching step by step..
/*
    ===>If we have an array like,
        1   2   4   5   8   9
        --->If we want to search 8 ?
        step 1.Go to the first index (found or not)
        step 2.Again, go to the second index (found or not)
        step 3.Again,go to the third index (found or not)
        --->Up to the element is not founded.
        --->If the element found then stop searching.
        --->Used for both sorted and unsorted array.

// Binary search means:-In binary search the algoriths is working like a doing half and half.This method is used for the sorted array.

        --->If we want to search 8 ?
        step 1.Making half of the array.
        step 2.We got the half is 5.
        stap 3.Check our element is bigger than the middle element or not if yes to take the second part and if no then take first part.
        stap 4.Still we can't find the element.
